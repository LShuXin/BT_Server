## Service Interactions

- `bigtalk_core_proxy_server` acts as a reverse proxy server.
- The client connects to `bigtalk_msg_server` through `bigtalk_core_proxy_server` to establish a long-lived IM connection.
- The client connects to `bigtalk_auth_server` through `bigtalk_core_proxy_server` for login authentication.
  - `bigtalk_auth_server` connects to `bigtalk_mariadb_server` via an internal network address.
- The client connects to `bigtalk_business_server` through `bigtalk_core_proxy_server` to access business APIs.
  - `bigtalk_business_server` connects to both `bigtalk_redis_server` and `bigtalk_mariadb_server` and `bigtalk_mongodb_server` via internal network addresses to perform business data read and write operations.
- The client connects to `bigtalk_msfs_server` through `bigtalk_core_proxy_server` to upload and download chat images.
- Users access `bigtalk_admin_server (admin dashboard)` through `bigtalk_core_proxy_server`.
  - `bigtalk_admin_server` communicates with `bigtalk_business_server` via an internal network for business API calls.
- Multiple instances of `bigtalk_msg_server` register with `bigtalk_route_server`, enabling users connected to different `bigtalk_msg_server` instances to communicate with each other.
- All `bigtalk_msg_server` instances register with `bigtalk_login_server`, which maintains load information for each `bigtalk_msg_server`.
- `bigtalk_msg_server` performs read and write operations on `bigtalk_redis_server` and `bigtalk_mariadb_server` through `bigtalk_db_proxy_server`.
